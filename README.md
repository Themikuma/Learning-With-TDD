# Learning-With-TDD
Loosly implementing the book https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/

There will be possible diviations from the book while still keeping up with the spirit of TDD and using the features introduced in each chapter.
The order of folders and modules will follow the order of the projects in the book. Every module will link to the chapter it's created in. The idea is to be accessible for both
beginer and advanced users who just want to jump into a different chapter.
